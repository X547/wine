 * NOTES:
 *    This file contains the X specific implementation for the windows
 *    Clipboard API.
 *
 *    Wine's internal clipboard is exposed to external apps via the X
 *    selection mechanism.
 *    Currently the driver asserts ownership via two selection atoms:
 *    1. PRIMARY(XA_PRIMARY)
 *    2. CLIPBOARD
 *
 *    In our implementation, the CLIPBOARD selection takes precedence over PRIMARY,
 *    i.e. if a CLIPBOARD selection is available, it is used instead of PRIMARY.
 *    When Wine takes ownership of the clipboard, it takes ownership of BOTH selections.
 *    While giving up selection ownership, if the CLIPBOARD selection is lost,
 *    it will lose both PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD and empty the clipboard.
 *    However if only PRIMARY is lost, it will continue to hold the CLIPBOARD selection
 *    (leaving the clipboard cache content unaffected).
 *
 *      Every format exposed via a windows clipboard format is also exposed through
 *    a corresponding X selection target. A selection target atom is synthesized
 *    whenever a new Windows clipboard format is registered via RegisterClipboardFormat,
 *    or when a built-in format is used for the first time.
 *    Windows native format are exposed by prefixing the format name with "<WCF>"
 *    This allows us to uniquely identify windows native formats exposed by other
 *    running WINE apps.
 *
 *      In order to allow external applications to query WINE for supported formats,
 *    we respond to the "TARGETS" selection target. (See EVENT_SelectionRequest
 *    for implementation) We use the same mechanism to query external clients for
 *    availability of a particular format, by caching the list of available targets
 *    by using the clipboard cache's "delayed render" mechanism. If a selection client
 *    does not support the "TARGETS" selection target, we actually attempt to retrieve
 *    the format requested as a fallback mechanism.
 *
 *      Certain Windows native formats are automatically converted to X native formats
 *    and vice versa. If a native format is available in the selection, it takes
 *    precedence, in order to avoid unnecessary conversions.
 *
 * FIXME: global format list needs a critical section
